\begin{abstract}
The goal of this experiment is to confirm the Duane-Hunt relation and determine the value of Planck's constant using the relation.
To do this, we use an X-Ray apparatus and its software to carry out the experiment and obtain the wavelength \(\lambda_{\min}\) values for specific voltages \(U\) of which are fitted using the LINEST algorithm.
The slope parameter \(m\) obtained from the fit is used in the Duane-Hunt relation to determine Planck's constant.
Our result \((h = (6.484 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s})\) for the Planck constant agrees with the accepted result of \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).

* Introduction

The X-Ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum has radiation of wavelengths around \(0.1 \text{ nm}\).
In a lab setting, X-Rays can be produced by accelerating a beam of electrons and colliding them into atoms.

The Duane-Hunt relation is the inverse proportionality between the wavelengths of X-Rays and voltages required to produce them [[cite:&duanehunt][duanehunt]].
One of the topics in recent physics literature that motivates the study of the Duane-Hunt relation is in the study of ceramic materials.
X-ray analysis of ceramic materials is a difficult challenge due to their elecrical insulation properties which cause buildup of surface charge and poor contrast in X-ray image.
The Duane-Hunt relation is used to study the electrical insulation properties of ceramics by eliminating the charge effect.

** Procedure

The X-ray apparatus and its software is used to collect the wavelength data at various configurations as listed in Table I.
We visually estimate the linear portion of the data and perform a linear fit on those portions, recording the slope as the minimum wavelength, \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) in pm.
We take two additional linear fits including additional points on either end of the region and determine the error in the measurement \(\Delta \lambda_{\text{min}}\) by taking the largest error between the original fit.
We use the set of \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) values obtained and plot them against \(1/U\) in 1/kV.
We apply a linear fit through the origin against this plot and record its slope \(m\).
To determine Planck's constant, we substitute \(m\) into the Duane-Hunt relation and evaluate the expression.

* Theoretical Background

When applying the best fit for the plot of \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) vs. \(1 / U\), we use the slope equation
\[y = mx \tag{1}\]
where \(m\) is the slope of the linear fit through the origin with a standard error \(\Delta m\).
The choice of fitting through the origin, rather than through a \(y\)-intercept, is based on the Duane-Hunt relation.
Solving for Planck's constant in the Duane-Hunt relation [[cite:&duanehunt][duanehunt]] we get,
\[h = \frac{me}{c} \tag{2}\]
where \(e\) is the elementary charge, and \(c\) is the speed of light.
The error in Planck's constant is calculated using the largest error from the minimum wavelength data,
\[\Delta h = \frac{\Delta \lambda_{\text{min}} U e}{c} \tag{3}\]
where \(U\) is the voltage corresponding to the data from which we obtained \(\Delta \lambda_{\text{min}}\).

* Results and Analysis

The linear fit through the origin of \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) vs. \(1/U\) (shown in Figure 2) has a slope, \(m = 1213 \text{ pm} \cdot \text{kV}\), and a standard error of the slope, \(\Delta m = \pm 2 \text{ pm} \cdot \text{kV}\).
The standard error for the slope \(\Delta m\) is small enough that it does not affect our results, so we omit them in our calculations.
Plugging the slope \(m\) into Equation 2, we find a value for Planck's constant, \(h = 6.484 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).
Using Equation 3, we find an error of \(\Delta h = 0.2 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).
The result we get for Planck's constant, \(h = (6.484 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\) agrees with the accepted value, \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).

* Conclusion

To determine Planck's constant \(h\), we used the Duane-Hunt relation (Equation 2).
In our experimental procedure, we found the slope \(m = 1213 \text{ pm}\cdot\text{kV}\) of the linear fit of \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) vs. \(1/U\) using the LINEST algorithm where \(m\) was the only unknown in the Duane-Hunt relation needed to determine Planck's constant.

One source of error in this lab was in the process of obtaining the \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) for each voltage, specifically in choosing which points to apply the best fit as we used a simple visual estimate.
We accounted for this error by taking the largest error \(\Delta \lambda_{\text{min}} = 1.3 \text{ pm}\) of the measured values for \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\) and used Equation 3 to find an error for Planck's constant \(\Delta h = 0.2 \text{ J s}\).
A suggestion to reduce this error would be to apply a nonlinear fit against the data instead and use the error values associated with such a fit.

We successfully determined Planck's constant, \(h = (6.484 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\) as it agrees with the accepted value, \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).

In determining Planck's constant using the Duane-Hunt relation we may use the results of this experiment to compare the conclusions of other potential different derivations of Planck's constant.
