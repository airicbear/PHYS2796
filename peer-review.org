* Summary

The goal of this experiment is to determine the value for the mercury excitation energy \(E_{\text{Hg}}\) by reproducing the Franck-Hertz experiment.
The experiment is a success, as the measured value \(E_{\text{Hg}} = 4.75 \pm 1.60\times 10^{-2} \text{ eV}\) is close to \(E_{\text{Hg}} = 4.9 \text{ eV}\) as expected.

* Notes

** Abstract

- The expected value does not fall within the error of the measured value

** Introduction

- Lacks discussion on relevance of experiment in recent physical research

** Experimental Method

- Lacks figure to show general schematic of experiment apparatus

** Theoretical Background

- Good

** Results and Analysis

- Lacks any mention of linear fit

  + Include fit plot

  + Include fit equation

- Explain how values were found using slope of linear fit

- Explain how error was obtained

- Explain why error is reasonable

** Conclusion

- Good

** References

- Appears to have inconsistent format
