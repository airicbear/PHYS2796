\begin{abstract}
The goal of this experiment is to verify the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation.
We use a cavity to act as a virtually ideal blackbody in this experiment.
The results from this experiment indeed are in agreement with the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
\end{abstract}

* Introduction

A blackbody is a body that absorbs all heat.
Kirchhoff was the first to propose a cavity as an ideal blackbody.
A cavity with a hole radiates energy proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature in a behavior defined as the *Stefan--Boltzmann law*.

One of the topics in recent physics literature that motivates the study of blackbody radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law is that of the \(n\)-Müser engine whereby an engine of the \(T^n\) heat transfer law is studied as opposed to the \(T^4\) heat transfer law where \(n > 0\) and \(n \in \mathbb{R}\).
The goal of these studies are to optimize heat engines with respect to certain ecological criterion.

* Experimental Method

** Equipment

Moll's thermopile, electric oven, blackbody accessory, the Leybold micro-voltmeter, digital thermometer with a temperature probe

** Procedure

First, we turned on the micrometer and connected the temperature probe to the thermometer and inserted the probe into the cavity.
Then we aligned the thermopile along the line of heat radiation, facing towards the cavity.
We turned on the oven to obtain a cavity temperature of \(T = 200^\circ\) and started recording the output voltage U of the thermopile every \(25^\circ\) increase.
Once \(T = 400^\circ\), we turned off the oven and started recording the output voltage U of the thermopile every \(25^\circ\) decrease.

* Theoretical Background

A cavity at temperature \(T\) within a surrounding ambient temperature of \(T_0\) has a net radiant flux of

\[I = \sigma(T^4 - {T_0}^4)\]

* Results and Analysis

The temperature of the air around the thermopile on the way up is \(T_0 = 20.1^\circ C\).
The temperature of the air around the thermopile on the way up is \(T_0 = 20.1^\circ C\).
The average ambient temperature was 293.1 K.

The linear fit calculations gave a slope of \(m = 0.03\) and a standard error of \(\Delta m = 0.0014\).

The relationship between \(U\) and \(T^4 - {T_0}^4\) is positively correlated.
That is, the potential difference \(U\) increases as the net radiant flux \(I\) increases.

The relationship holds across the entire data.
Factors that may have influenced the measurements include error in the alignment of the thermopile.

* Conclusion

The results of this lab confirm the Stefan-Boltzmann Law by showing that the energy radiated by a blackbody is indeed proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature minus the ambient temperature to the fourth power.
