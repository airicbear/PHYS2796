\begin{abstract}
The goal of this lab is to apply the photoelectric effect to calculate the value for Planck's constant.
To do this, we use the PASCO photoelectric effect apparatus and collect the necessary data.
We obtain a comparable value of \(h = 6.360 \times  \text{ J s}\) which matches our expectations.

* Introduction

The photoelectric effect refers to the emission of electrons from the surface of a metal when it is illuminated with light.
The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons.
Originally it was predicted by the classical wave model that the energy of the emitted electrons would increase as the brightness of the light increased.

In 1902 Philip Lenard found that the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, for a given metal, solely depended on the color/frequency of the light and no electrons would be emitted below a certain threshold frequency.

In 1905 Albert Einstein explained Lenard's discoveries using Planck's Theory of radiation.

** Procedure

1. Uncover window of Photodiode enclosure and place the 2 mm diameter aperture and 365 nm onto window of enclosure.

2. Uncover the window of the mercury light source producing 365 nm wavelength spectral lines on cathode.

3. Turn the VOLTAGE ADJUST knob so the ammeter reads zero current.

4. Record magnitude of stopping potential for 365 nm wavelength.

5. Cover the window of the mercury light source.

6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the 4mm and 8mm apertures.

7. Repeat the measurement for the other filters.

8. Record magnitude of stopping potential for each wavelength and each aperature.

* Theoretical Background

We use the slope-intercept equation for best fit,

\[y = mx + b \tag{1}\]

We determine the value for Planck's constant using the equation

\[h = me \tag{2}\]

where \(m\) is the slope of the best fit and \(e\) is the elementary charge.

* Results and Analysis

#+CAPTION: Linear fit for photoelectric effect data

The linear fit has a slope, \(m = -0.40 \text{ V/}(1 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz})\), and standard error of the slope, \(\Delta m = -0.003 \text{ V/}(1 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz})\).
The linear fit has an intercept, \(b = 1.4\text{ V}\), and standard error of the intercept, \(\Delta b = 1.4\text{ V}\).

Applying Equation (2), we get a magnitude of \(h = 6.360 \times  \text{ J s}\) for the Planck constant which is comparable to the accepted value \(h_0 = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}\).
The differences between the calculated value and accepted value may be due to noise, for example due to the environment.

In applying a linear fit against the data for average stopping potential (V) versus intensity, we obtained a slope \(m = -0.96 \text{ eV/V}\) and intercept \(b = 1.43 \text{ V}\) with respective standard errors of \(\Delta m = 0.008 \text{ eV/V}\) and \(\Delta b = 1.43 \text{ V}\).
